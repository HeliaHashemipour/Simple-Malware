# Introduction

- Part I

	1. First, using the socket library, I set up a local server named server.py.
	2. Then create a malware called malware.py and once it is executed, it can connect to the local server created in the first step.
	3. Using a message, it shows that the above two steps are done correctly.

- Part II

	1. After completing the first part, write the malware.py file in such a way that as soon as it connects to the server, it returns the information about the victim's system to the server.

- Part III

	In the last part, when the connection between the victim's system and the attacker's server is established correctly, the following two things are possible:
	1. The attacker can get information about the victim's system by entering the sysinfo command
	2. The connection established between the server and the victim's system should not be interrupted by entering the above command, and this connection should be established as long as the attacker wants.
